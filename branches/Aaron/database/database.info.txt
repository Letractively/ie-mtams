I have created a few linux bash scripts to convert mysql export scripts into 
derby create scripts. 

I have commented out a number of useful lines like the create schema line at the
start of every tables creation sql file.
-- CREATE SCHEMA "mtams" ;
-- SET SCHEMA  "mtams";
The default schema that is used if you do not specify one is the "APP" schema.
Uncomment those lines if you wish to use a different schema when creating files. 
I have also commented out the insert statements for all tables. These can be uncommented if you wish these inserts to add data into the tables upon creation. As
there are numerous dependencies between tables all inserts will have to be uncommented for them to work. 

I have created a spearate file that combines all the create table files into one single file.  Called "mtams.create.sql"

I have also create a sepeart insert or data insert file. Called "mtams.data.sql"

# my notes for performing certain actions don't worry about trying to understand# any of this at this point I might add  explainations at some point in the 
# future. 

Brilliant info on RBAC with nice explainations of how they all work.

# Usefull command for database exports and conversions

mysqldump --single-transaction --compatible=db2 -u mtams -pmtams mtams > mtams.db2.sql
mysqldump --single-transaction -u mtams -pmtams mtams > mtams.sql


find mtams_*.sql | xargs -I{} sh -c "sed -f ./fix.sql.script.sed {} > {}.derby"

#find *.derby | xargs -I{} sh -c 'echo run "{}" >> create.derby.sql'

find *.derby | xargs -I{} sh -c 'echo "run \"{}\";" >> create.derby2.sql'

cp ../mysql/mtams_* .
find ./mtams_*.sql | xargs -I{} sh -c "sed -i.old -f ../fix.sql.script.sed {}"

default schema for create tables in a new derby database is the schema called
app. 

reverse the order grep finds drop statements to drop tables with foreign key constraints
grep -i "DROP " ./mtams.create.sql | tac

special order changes to allow for creation script to work
Itinerary needs to come after Travel
