few things to note:

I put back sessions after de-activating them for mondays presentation.
Im sure it works but I might have missed something. 

Also during my experimentation of view application i removed the direct links to view an application. so you'll
have to sneak around it. in the session bean where it directs users to userHome you'll have to change that to viewApplication
( i have it commented ). and in the application bean look for a method called loadValues() and above that put 
@PostConstruct and change the integer id in the method to the id of the application in the database you wish to view/edit

I'll have it fixed during the holiday proper



Things we want to show
-----------------------
I wasnt able to fully implement ajax validation for the forms and all fields so for the sake of the video i put
it validation for the first-name field in the traveller profile.

The logo on the view travel profile is a link to home page, so if you can find a way to use it in some sense
----------------------

of course if there is anything let me know. should be awake until midnight
